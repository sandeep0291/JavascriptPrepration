Q7. What is the difference between application cache and browser cache.
    // HTML5 provides application cache, which means that a web application is cached, 
    // and accessible without an internet connection. Application cache gives an application three advantages:
    //   Offline browsing - users can use the application when they're offline
    //   Speed - cached resources load faster Reduced server load - the
    //   browser will only download updated/changed resources from the server Browser cache

    //   Internet browsers use caching to store HTML web pages by storing a copy of visited pages and then using that copy to render when you re-visit that page. 
    // . If the date on the page is the same date as the previously stored copy, then the computer uses the one on your hard drive rather than re-downloading it from the internet.
